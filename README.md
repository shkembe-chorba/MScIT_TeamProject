## University of Glasgow MSc IT+ Team Project

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/c4acd5855574440a93718b20eef7f4d8)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/shkembe-chorba/MScIT_TeamProject?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=shkembe-chorba/MScIT_TeamProject&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)

This project was created as part of the IT+ programmes at the University of Glasgow, which include Software Development, Information Technology, and Information Security.

The goal of the project was to design, implement, and test a small but reasonably complex software system in a self-organised team of 5 students. The project was an opportunity to put into practice skills learned on the Programming and Database Theory and Applications courses. It also contained various developmental aspects, such as: 

- Understanding and using previously unseen technologies (such as [Java's Dropwizard framework](https://www.dropwizard.io/en/latest/) and the [Maven build tools](https://maven.apache.org/)).
- Learning and applying previously unseen project management methodologies (specifically, the [Scrum framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development))).

Further information can be found in the accompanying  documentation:

- The [project specification](Project%20Specification.pdf) provided by the university.
- The [final report](Report.pdf) produced by the team.
- JavaDoc comments throughout the source code.
